    <h5>A concierge is a person or a company that is available to help you in your day-to-day life. 
        <p/>Their services can range from planning and booking your family holidays to making restaurant reservations or getting you access to special events. Some concierge companies also provide financial services. Others might focus on event organisation or high-end travel reservations.

The word concierge probably comes from the old French word “comte des cierges.”
<p/> The comte des cierges was a servant responsible for maintaining the lighting and cleanliness of medieval palaces.

Today’s concierge services extend far beyond just maintaining your candles lit. 
<p/>Concierges are highly skilled people who can add real value to your life by taking care of some essential and time-consuming tasks for you. They also have an extensive network to help you get VIP access to some of the most ultra-exclusive events and experiences around the world.

<p/>In general, you’ll find two categories of concierge services today:

Personal concierge services: if you want to hire the services of a concierge for yourself.
Corporate concierge services: if a company wants to provide concierge services to its employees as an extra benefit.</h5>
